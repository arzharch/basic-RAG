# Project README: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Implementation

## Objective:
The objective of this project is to **learn and implement Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using Python**.

## What is RAG?

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an approach that combines retrieval models and generative models to provide more accurate and contextually relevant answers to user queries.

### How does RAG work?

1. **Input Query:** The process begins with an input query. This can be any text requiring a detailed response, such as a user’s question or information request.
   
2. **Information Retrieval:** The retrieval model extracts relevant information from knowledge bases, databases, or external sources. Multiple sources can be searched simultaneously depending on the nature of the query.

3. **Vectorization:** The extracted information is converted into high-dimensional vectors and stored in a vector database.

4. **Ranking:** The retrieval model ranks the documents or passages based on their relevance to the query and selects the most relevant content for further processing.

5. **Text Generation:** A generation model, such as a Large Language Model (LLM), uses the retrieved information to generate text responses.

6. **Post-Processing:** The generated text may undergo post-processing to ensure grammatical correctness, coherence, and relevance.

7. **Contextual Accuracy:** The final response is shaped by the retrieved information, ensuring it is accurate and contextually sensible.

## Why is RAG needed?

- **Improved Answer Accuracy:** RAG ensures that answers are generated based on the most relevant and up-to-date information available.
- **Enhanced Data Privacy:** With RAG, the data can be processed locally, ensuring privacy without relying on external services.
- **Dynamic and Contextual Responses:** By using retrieved knowledge, RAG provides responses that are not only precise but also tailored to the user’s specific query.

## Issues Faced:

- **Resource Constraints:** While attempting to use a powerful LLM from Huggingface on Google Colab, resource limitations led to crashes as it required more memory than allocated by Colab. As a result, a lower-powered LLM was used, which resulted in slightly less accurate answers.

---

## Requirements:

1. **Huggingface Token:**
   - You will need a Huggingface token, which can be obtained for free from [Huggingface's website](https://huggingface.co).

2. **Libraries:**
   - `pypdf`: Helps load PDF files and extract text from them.
   - `language-transformers`: Used to generate human-like text based on retrieved information.
   - `langchain-community`: Enhances context-aware reasoning and expands the scope of accessible knowledge in text generation.
   - `gradio`: Provides an interactive user interface for asking questions and receiving responses.

---

## Setup Instructions:

1. **Install dependencies**:

   First, make sure you have the required libraries installed. You can install them using `pip`:

   ```bash
   pip install pypdf language-transformers langchain-community gradio
   ```

2. **Huggingface API Token**:
   - Sign up on [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co) and generate an API token. Store it in your environment or directly pass it in the code where needed.

3. **Running the Application**:
   - Once the dependencies are installed and your token is ready, you can run the script to load the retrieval model, process the query, and generate responses.

4. **Interactive UI (Gradio)**:
   - The project includes an interactive interface using Gradio, allowing users to input their queries and receive answers based on the retrieval-augmented generation process.

## Conclusion:

This project demonstrates how Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) can be implemented using Python, combining the power of retrieval models and generative models to create dynamic, context-aware, and accurate text responses.
